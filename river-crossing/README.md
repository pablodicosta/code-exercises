Three monkeys and three wolves want to get to the other side of a river. There is a small boat, which can fit only two. To prevent a tragedy of a wolf eating a monkey, there can never be more wolves than monkeys together.
The solution is as follows if done with five input steps requested from the user where the user must be prompted each time with which two will row across and which one will row back to get another.

1 wolf and 1 monkey row there, monkey rows back. 
2 wolves row there, 1 wolf rows back. 
2 monkeys row there, 1 monkey and 1 wolf rows back. 
2 monkeys row there, 1 wolf rows back. 
This one wolf takes the remaining wolves to the other side.
